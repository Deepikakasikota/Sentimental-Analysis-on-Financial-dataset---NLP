Here, I use Financial dataset to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Sentiment Analysis is also known as opinion mining. It is used on the web to analyse the attitude, behaviour, and emotional state of the sender. This application is implemented through a combination of NLP (Natural Language Processing) and statistics by assigning the values to the text (positive, negative, or natural), identify the mood of the context (happy, sad, angry, etc.)
